I am a computational biologist, currently in the [Translational Vectorology Research Unit](https://www.cmrijeansforgenes.org.au/research/research-teams/translational-vectorology) at [CMRI](https://www.cmrijeansforgenes.org.au/).  I'm interested in all all things genomics, bioinformatics, gene therapy and AI.  I was previously a member of the [Tranformational Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatics.csiro.au/) group at [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/), and before that I was a student in [Radu Aricescu's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radu_Aricescu) group at the University of Oxford (now at the [Laboratory of Molecular Biology](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwixsI7a2cKDAxWrZ_UHHSChClEQFnoECAgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk%2Fgroup-leaders%2Fa-to-g%2Fradu-aricescu%2F&usg=AOvVaw1PcftGeKelrgwpjXYfzZMb&opi=89978449) in Cambridge).
