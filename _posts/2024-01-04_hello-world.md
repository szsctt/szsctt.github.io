# Hi!

This is my first post, following in the long tradition of 'Hello, world!'.  

I plan to use this site to collect some of the various things I've done - projects I've been involved in, things I've built, as well as various thoughts and ramblings. The intention is to keep it up to date with various bits and pieces that I've created or adapted that I think might be useful (or just fun) for other people.  Stay tuned for more!
