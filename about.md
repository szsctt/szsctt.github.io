I am a computational biologist, currently in the [Translational Vectorology Research Unit](https://www.cmrijeansforgenes.org.au/research/research-teams/translational-vectorology) at [CMRI](https://www.cmrijeansforgenes.org.au/).  I'm interested in all all things genomics, bioinformatics, gene therapy and AI.
